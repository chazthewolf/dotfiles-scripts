`fastfetch.jsonc` must be renamed to config.jsonc to be used by fastfetch. 
`taz_logo` is my custom fastfetch logo.

On windows, this is stored in `C:/ProgramData/fastfetch/config.jsonc`

On *nix it's stored in `~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc`

See [fastfetch-cli/fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) repo for more details.
